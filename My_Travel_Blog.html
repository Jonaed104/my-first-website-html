        <h3>18 February 2024, 8:00 pm </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>That was my first time that I had traveled a long way from <b>Dhaka</b> to <b>Cox's Bazar</b>. I was so
            excited when the time arrived to start the journey. Around 7:45 pm our bus reached our offices area and we
            all stared to take out sit. Then just 8:00 pm our the driver started to drive the bus. After a few moments
            our senior officers started to chilling and singing song.</p>

        <h3>18 February 2024, 11:00 pm </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>Around 11 o'clock our bus reached near <i>Kamlapur Railway Station</i>. And near there we were took our first
            meal of this journey. We were around 30 people and we all took our dinner at a hotel. We all ate a super
            tasty dish called <i>Latka Khicuri with chicken</i> and that's taste was awesome. Like, when I took my first
            bite I screamed out <b>"Ooooooh sugoi!"</b>. That's a Japanese word whatever. After had a tasty dinner we
            took our sit again in the bus and the driver started the bus again for the <b>Cox's Bazar</b>. And I enjoyed
            the night beauty of city with hearing song from youtube and I slept by tiredness. Cause, all day long i've
            done my job at my office.</p>

        <h3>19 February 2024, 2:00 am </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>We reached a we known restaurant on the way of <b>Dhaka to Chittagong</b> named <strong>Red Star Hotel &
                Resort</strong> in <b>Cumilla</b>. We took some snacks and walk around and some of use need to use
            washroom, so they used it.</p>

        <h3>19 February 2024, 6:00 am </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>At 6:00 am, we reached <b>Chittagong</b> and prayed to almighty <strong>Allah</strong> in a Mosque named
            <strong>Upazila Model Mosque and Islamic Cultural Center</strong>. Then after two hours we reached
            <strong>OKM MIDWAY INN LTD.</strong> restaurant.
        </p>

        <h3>19 February 2024, 10:30 am </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>Around 10:30 am we reached <b>Rangamati</b> and took our breakfast near a roadside hotel. We took <i> ruti,
                dim vaji, sobji ranna and cha</i> for our breakfast. And that was the second meal we had done in the
            journey. After taking the breakfast we went to the local market to buy a special footwear for tracking.
            After changing our clothes we started our tracking.</p>

        <h3>19 February 2024, 12:00 pm </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>Around 12:00 pm we rent four boats to reach the fountain of <i>Rangamati</i>. I was in the first boat and the
            boat experience was so wild. I enjoyed the boat journey a lot. We reached our fountain after two hours. But
            the problem was created, we reached our goal our other three boats weren't reached there. So we had to stay
            on that place for a long time. In this time we took some snacks for passing our times and after two hours we
            reached that place other boats are started to come there.</p>

        <h3>19 February 2024, 03:00 pm </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->
        <p>After our all boats reached the place where we were, we started our tracking for <i>Jhum Ghor</i>. We walk
            through the jungle and the side of mountain. After an hour of tracking, we finally reached our <i> Jhum
                Ghor</i>. And we take bath in a fountain. The local name of this fountain is <em>Thankoain</em>.</p>

        <h3>19 February 2024, 05:00 pm </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>As soon as we took bath in fountain our body started shivering in cold and weakness. Then the local guy
            started to dinner and we started to chilling with singing songs and so on. About 8 o'clock we took our
            dinner and the calmness of jungle make me so excited. After taking dinner I went for sleep but the night was
            so cold so I'm stared to freezing. But I managed it somehow and slept because of tiredness.</p>

        <h3>20 February 2024, 03:00 am </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>At the end of the night, I awoke for the low temperature. And I noticed some of my colleagues and seniors
            started to make a camp fire in front of <i>Jhum Ghor</i>. We felt better after having the warm of camp fire.
            We stay there for few moments and enjoy the environment. The I sleep again.</p>

        <h3>20 February 2024, 06:00 am </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>At 6 o'clock I woke up and prayed my <i>Fajar</i> prayed. Then our seniors told us to have the breakfast
            cause we were going to leave this place. And I went for the breakfast and have the breakfast. After taking
            my breakfast, we stared to tracking again. After finish our tracking we took a vehicle called <i>Cander
                Gari</i> by their local name and started to enjoy the narrow and risky road of mountain. That was so
            horrible experience for all of us. whatever, after all we reached to our bus and started journey for
            <b>Cox's Bazar</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>20 February 2024, 04:00 pm </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>After a journey we reached <strong>Inani Beach</strong> near <b>Cox's Bazar</b>. We took bath in a swimming
            pool, played badminton in playground, sung song with guitar and enjoyed in many different ways. Then I and
            my senior went to enjoy the environment of a beach, cause that was my first time to visiting beach so I was
            super excited. While enjoying in the beach our guide call us for take dinner because some of use hadn't take
            any meal in whole day and maintain the rules of this resort we took our meal as soon as possible. We ate
            beef curry in dinner. Though it's a high calory food for night, we took it cause of hunger. After had the
            dinner I took a little rest and went to the beach again. Then our manager and so senior guys came there and
            we gossip here for late night. Around 12 0'clock I went to sleep.</p>

        <h3>21 February 2024, 08:00 am </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <p>Hmm, i woke up on that day so late. Then look around and took my breakfast. Then I waited for my senior. When
            I saw him, I asked him to visit <b>Cox's Bazar</b>. He wanted to go with me and we head out soon.</p>

        <h3>21 February 2024, 10:30 am </h3> <!-- thats a heading-->

        <P>Now we reached <b>Cos'x Bazar Beach</b>. That was Friday so a lot of people was there to enjoy the beach. It
            looks like ant house from a bit far. Jokes a part! We saw a lot of things and I will add them below in list
            items. Don't forget to check. After enjoyed the beach we went for pray the <i>Jumma Salat</i>. After prayed
